# Overview

I have worked with several databases, but I believed a small data mart fits the needs for specific processes, so I did this project to increase my learning.

The software provides these basic functions:
- Display Table
- Change Rows 
- Add Rows
- Delete Rows

This will be the basics for a multi-relational database. The software will carry over except for the many to many relationships.
