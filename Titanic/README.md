# Overview

I have worked on a few machine learning projects before, but they all had been on a team or guided by a teacher. This is my shot at a machine learning project

The project will allow a user to determine their survivability on the titanic. 


Even though the prompt process will be in the terminal, the project uses many techcniques displayed in machine learning. Disclaimer. The accuracy of the model is spotty, so I wouldn't say it was a total success
