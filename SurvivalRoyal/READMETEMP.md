# Overview

I wanted to do some work on a game platform. I wish to expand this project to make it multiplayer and finish out  some of the mechanics

I got pretty far. This game is meant to reenact a royal setting. I got to some of the mechanics of the game, but I need a dead sweeper and some nice things like an intro screen, death screen, level up.
