# Overview

I have learned quite a bit on web development, but the concepts have been out of my reach. Using django is the optimal solution combining my limited understanding of websites with my greater understanding of python

This project will have:
- Home Page, Hello World, and a dynamic page
- A Pig Latin Translator
- A English to Pig Latin Translator

Using the versatility of django, I was able to have dynamic pages that respond to user input on a form. Also the page will change user input as well. Disclaimer this project does not contain any real CSS styling so it is basic
